# Simple Web Project üåê

This is a simple web project that consists of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. The project provides a basic web template that you can use as a starting point for your web development projects. üöÄ

## Bookshelf App üìö

The Bookshelf App is designed to help users manage their reading list effectively. It allows users to organize books into two categories: "To Read" and "Read". This application is part of the Dicoding certification program, which is an online learning platform that offers courses in various fields, including web development, mobile development, and data science. You can view the certification details [here](https://www.dicoding.com/certificates/N9ZO93NMYXG5).

### Features of the Bookshelf App:

1. **Add New Books**: Users can add new book entries to their bookshelf.
2. **Two Bookshelves**: The app features two bookshelves:
   - "To Read": This shelf stores books that have not yet been completed (isComplete property is false).
   - "Read": This shelf stores books that have been completed (isComplete property is true).
3. **Move Books Between Shelves**: Users can move books between the "To Read" and "Read" shelves.
4. **Delete Books**: Users can delete books from either shelf.
5. **Local Storage**: The app utilizes localStorage to ensure that the book data persists even when the web page is closed. This means that the book data will remain available when the user returns to the app.

In this project, you will master the Browser Object Model (BOM) and Document Object Model (DOM) manipulation using JavaScript, implement interactive features through event handling in HTML elements, and utilize browser APIs for data storage with Web Storage, including local and session storage. The final project involves building an interactive website with DOM manipulation and Web Storage integration.
